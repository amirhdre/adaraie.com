  abstract={We introduce Dreamento (Dream engineering toolbox), an open-source Python package for dream
  engineering utilizing the ZMax (Hypnodyne Corp., Sofia, Bulgaria) headband sleep wearable. Dreamento
  main functions are (1) real-time recording, monitoring, analysis, and stimulation in a graphical user
  interface (GUI) (2) and offline post-processing of the resulting data. In real-time, Dreamento is capable of
  (1) recording data, (2) visualizing data, including power-spectrum analysis and navigation, (3) automatic
  sleep-scoring, (4) sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, tactile), (5) establishing text-to-speech
  communication, and (6) managing the annotations of automatic and manual events. The offline
  functionality aids in post-processing the acquired data with features to reformat the wearable data and
  integrate it with non-wearable recorded modalities such as electromyography. While the primary
  application of Dreamento was developed for(lucid) dreaming studies, it is open to being adapted for other
  purposes and measurement modalities.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
