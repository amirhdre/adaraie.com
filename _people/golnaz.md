I only had so little time to get to know Golnaz, but that changed my life. In Iran, when students study at a top university, they usually apply for a US graduate program soon after finishing their BSc. However, this trend was delayed for a year because of the corona pandemic. Amid all the chaos in the world, Golnaz was relentlessly trying to get admission to her dream school and program, the neuroengineering Ph.D. program at the University of Pittsburgh. 

Her motivation, determination, and sense of calm and brevity caught me. I remember how my days became full of hope and effervescence after talking with her on the phone for an hour. Surprisingly she suggested that I apply to the BME program at Johns Hopkins! I got into this dreamy program because she embodied the light in me.
