Hossein was my TA in Digital Image Processing course during my sixth semseter as an undergrad. His precision, attention to nauneced datails, responsiveness, and humility striked me since the beginning. 

I was lucky to get closer to him and discover what good friends we can be for each other while promoting each others in science and our advocacy acitivies. Hossein loves to communicate science and share his knowledge with others. He believes in data. 

The thing that surprised me about him was that he believed in science and science-based tools to optimize his life so much that he started to systematically collect data about his own mental health and tried to optimize and enhance it with state-of-the-art neuroscience and cogntive science methods.
