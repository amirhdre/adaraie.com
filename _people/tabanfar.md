Zahra was my BSc project supervisor at Amirkabir University of technology. Before me, she worked with successful students like Ali Barzegar and Alireza Ettefagh. So this motivated me to take my thesis project with her. I made the best decision I could.

She was a true scientist, wise, responsive, and always motivating. She helped me finish my project in late July, sooner than every other student in my cohort. The reason was that I wanted to graduate earlier to send my transcripts and bachelor's degree to Johns Hopkins University for my Ph.D. on time. 

I got the best-written feedback from her, and she showed me how I should manage my undergraduate students when I become a project advisor. I had many sweet working memories with them, and It was a pure privilege to work under her supervisor during my undergraduate at Amirkabir in 2022.
