Hamid was two years senior to me. I got to know him in 2020 when he was my TA in Signals and Systems and Engineering Mathematics courses taught by Dr. Fallah. While studying BME as a major, Hamid decided to take computer engineering courses and minor in CE. Based on this and many other decisions, he proved to be intelligent, responsive, and always considering his future.

Despite all of his success, he made some time to teach us mathematics and give us advice about life, success, and our academic journey. His classes were full of joy, questions, and love. 

After finishing his undergrad, despite having admissions from top universities in Iran, he decided to join the electrical engineering department at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, to work on signals and communication for his master's degree.
