During the summer of 2021, I went to the Netherlands to work on a sleep research project at Donders institute. Our lab supervisor, Dr. Martin Dresler, has assigned Mahdad as my internship mentor and project supervisor. He picked me up upon my arrival to Nijmegen and brought me close to himself and his family. Mahdad was very sociable, and I picked many of his lovely characteristics. Interestingly, my workspace was beside him, so we saw each other daily and collaborated closely while sharing most of our time. 

Surprisingly, we didn't end up working together only in science; we played tennis, went out on weekends, and hung out almost every night in his lovely room at SHN Sterrenbosch. I remember going to my house in an old monastery in the middle of the Sionsweg forest around 1 AM after hanging out and watching Iranian movies with him.

Mahdad taught me how to be resilient. One of his main characteristics was that he could focus on one thing and accomplish it in a short amount of time. He was efficient, fast, reliable, and always knew how to manage his time. I loved it when I saw he could manage to have a girlfriend, do science, do sport, and also take weekends off! He identified what needed to be done and always did it, whatever it took.

I never thought we could get this close! We went together to Barcelona, Spain, in July 2021. It was the most fun trip I had until 21. The trip was full of memories, love, sightseeing, and excitement. Mahdad was not only my science teammate but also my bigger brother, the one I never had.

Upon my return to Iran, he managed to continue the research we started together on the neuroscience of lucid dreaming. He moved forward and expanded the software I wrote during my internship called Dreamento. We published our first paper together, Dreamento: an open-source dream engineering toolbox for sleep EEG wearables. In this paper, we described the toolbox and paved the way for future investigations in dream engineering and open-source EEG recordings. 

We are still planning to work together on future projects; two of them are ongoing projects on citizen neuroscience and a multi-center study of lucid dream induction. The more I work with him, the more I want. I was lucky to have him as my colleague, life-long friend, and brother.
