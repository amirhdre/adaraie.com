description: The simplest writing process is to start with what you know best and build from there. It will assist you in putting pen to paper and creating a well-rounded article with just the perfect amount of scope at the beginning and end to pique a reader‚Äôs interest before leaving them happy with your findings. Here I will try to explain the best approach to write a research paper after doing the epxeriments and data-analysis.

The simplest writing process is to **start with what you know best and build from there**. It will assist you in putting pen to paper and creating a well-rounded article with just the perfect amount of scope at the beginning and end to pique a reader's interest before leaving them happy with your findings.

This implies that you will not begin writing at the beginning of the document. Why?

To figure it out, let's look at a graph of the paper's scope from beginning to end:

</p>

As you can see, the introduction of a paper has the greatest scope, whereas the figures, materials, and results, which you are most familiar with, have the narrowest scope. This is why starting to write from the beginning is so difficult - the scope is so broad that it's difficult to figure out what to say or how much to say.

It is considerably easier to write your paper if you use a workflow that starts with the smallest scope and works its way outward.

Another bigger benefit of writing a manuscript in this order is that it will help make sure the flow of your writing is well suited to attracting and keeping a reader‚Äôs attention.

When you write a manuscript in this order, you may ensure that the flow of your writing is well-suited to attracting and maintaining a reader‚Äôs attention. 

**Recommended Manuscript Writing Order:**

As a result, I recommend writing papers in the following order, beginning with the portions that are the most familiar and easy to write. It then expands on what has already been written to make parts with a broader scope easier to consider and handle.

1. **Figures**¬†‚Äì Starting with the figures forces the paper to have an organizational structure and a plot. The story and scope of the document are established by first gathering data into 4-8 compact figures that follow a logical arrangement.
2. **Materials and methods**¬†‚Äì Having the figures in place, writing the first section of the paper text is now simple. This section describes the materials and methods required to collect the data that compose the figures. Conveniently, you should be the most familiar with this part of the work; thus, writing it should be easy and fun. You were deeply acquainted with these on a daily basis and had hands-on experience with them.
3. **Results**¬†‚Äì The results describe what was **seen and discovered** when you were performing the experiments you discussed in the materials and methods section. This section logically **follows the materials and methods** and flows easily from that. More tips on writing up your results later.
