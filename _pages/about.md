I am is a Ph.D. student at the Biomedical Engineering Department at The [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/). 

I received my bachelor’s in biomedical engineering and minored in electrical engineering (control) at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), Tehran. I also worked as a research intern at [Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging](https://www.ru.nl/donders/), Netherlands. At the [Donders Sleep & Memory Lab](https://dreslerlab.org/), under the supervision of Professor Martin Dresler, I developed soft- and hardware solutions for home-based sleep recordings and sleep modulation using single-electrode EEG and deep and machine learning algorithms. 

I have several years of experience as a software developer and embedded system designer in [international robotics competitions](https://www.robocup.org/) (RoboCup).
